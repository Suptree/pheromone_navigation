This project contributes to an open source ROS-based framework for swarm robotics. We propose an low cost, high availability swarm system that could be printed and assembled multiple times without special knowledge or hardware skills.

# PCB Manufacturer

If you intend to maker the PCB by yourself, see the PCB version 2.1. These versions are simplified to make easy to developed it.

Case you intend to order the PCB from a professional manufacturer, look for the most recent version.

# Version Description

## v2.1
- Uses pinholes as vias, since it is dificult to produce vias in homemade PCB.
- Fix inconsistency 

## v2.3
- Change pinholes to vias, since we intent to order this board from PCB manufacturer.
- Fix motor conectors position

## v2.4
- Added battery charge module (TP4056)
- Update silk

## v2.5
- Change darlington-pair to mosfet
