<b>HeRo PCB design!</b>
<p>This is the second version of HeRo PCB. In this version of the PCB we decide to fix the pinhole (used as vias) to original vias since we intend to order the PCBs. In this subversion, we include the battery charge module in the main PCB board. Also we attach the switch on the side of the robot. </p>
