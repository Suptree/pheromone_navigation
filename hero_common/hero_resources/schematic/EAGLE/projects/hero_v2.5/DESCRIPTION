<b>HeRo PCB design!</b>
<p>This is the second version of HeRo PCB. In this version of the PCB we decide to fix the pinhole (used as vias) to original vias since we intend to order the PCBs. This version is ideal for ones that intend to send the PCB to a professional manufactory. We include the battery charge module into the main PCB board and also change the darlin-pair to a small mosfet. </p>
